<div style="padding: 5px; background-color: #F0F0F0;">
__This is__ a Rmd-template for protocols and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It synthesizes three sources of standards:

* [PRISMA-P](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i4086)
* [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/)
* [MARS](https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000389)

The template is __aimed at__

* guiding the process of planning systematic review/meta-analyses
* providing a form for preregistration (enter your text, export as standalone HTML or PDF, upload as preregistration to any preferred repository)

We are aware that MARS targets aspects of reporting after the systematic review/meta-analysis is completed rather than decisions and reasoning in the planning phase as PRISMA-P and PROSPERO. MARS nevertheless provides a good framework to determine crucial points for systematic reviews/ meta-analyses to be addressed as early as in the planning phase.
