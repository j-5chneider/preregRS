<div style="padding: 5px; background-color: #F0F0F0;">
__This is__ a Rmd-template for protocols and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It synthesizes three sources of standards:

* [PRISMA-P](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i4086)
* [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/)
* [MARS](https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000389)

The template is __aimed at__

* guiding the process of planning the systematic review/ meta-analysis
* providing a form for preregistration (enter your text, export as standalone html, upload as preregistration)

We are aware that MARS targets aspects of reporting after the systematic review/ meta-analysis is completed rather than decisions and reasoning in the planning phase as PRISMA-P and PROSPERO. MARS nevertheless provides a good framework to determine crucial points for systematic reviews/ meta-analyses to be addressed as early as in the planning phase.

| standard |  implemented change  | reason                      |
|:---------|:---------------------|:----------------------------|
| MARS |  Left out paper section "Abstract"  |  An abstract is important for reporting, not however, for planning and registering. |
| MARS |  Left out paper section "Results" and parts of "Discussion"  |  Specifications on how to report results is important for reporting, not however, for planning and registering. Prospective information on how results will be computed/ synthesized is preserved. |
| MARS | Left out "Protocol: List where the full protocol can be found" | This form practically is the protocol. |
|  PROSPERO  |  Left out non-mandatory fields or integrated them with mandatory fields.  |  Avoiding too detailed specifications. All relevant information will be integrated. |
| PROSPERO | Left out some options in "Type and method of review" | Options left out are purely health/ medicine related. |
| PROSPERO | Left out "Health area of the review" | This field is purely health/ medicine related. |
