### Fill out Template

* We recommend to compile the .Rmd file first to get a glimpse at how the final preregistration will be structured (sections). Do this by hitting the "knit" button in RStudio.
* To get a better idea of what you can specify in each section, we included the original descriptions from the sources used (PRISMA-P, PROSPERO, MARS). Get this information by clicking the "more info" button in the compiled HTML or check out the tables under the section headings in the PDF.
* Start filling out the .Rmd template by replacing `_Put your text here._` with your information.
* Compile the .Rmd file to HTML (or PDF)
* Upload this preregistration protocol to a platform to make it publicly available with time stamp (e.g. [osf.io](https://osf.io/), [psycharchives.org](https://www.psycharchives.org/))
